# Rankings

* Individual (men)
* Individual (women)
* Individual sprinter (men)
* Individual sprinter (women)
* Faculty
* Study association

The sprinter rankings are based on the time in the last 100 m of the course. This point will be clearly marked.

For a team to qualify for the team rankings (faculty and study associations), it should contain at least four people! The team rankings are based on the sum of the times of the best two men and best two women. Furthermore, every additional contestant from that faculty/study association subtracts 1 second from the team's time. If the team does not contain either two men or women, additional times from the other gender are used with a time penalty for women counting as men of 40%.

The faculty ranking consists only of faculties from the Radboud University and the HAN. The study association rankings can only be entered by those of/associated with the Radboud University or the HAN. For both, a contestant can indicate their affiliation during registration.

# Prizes

There will be three medals for every individual ranking, a challenge cup ("wisselbeker") for the faculty ranking and a cup for the study associations' ranking.

# Registration

Registration is possible for a reduced fee until a few days before the race (see [registration](/registration/)) and on the day itself (also see [registration](/registration/) for more details). Restitution after payment is not possible. You cannot participate without registration and corresponding payment.

# Starting numbers

Contestants should collect the starting number before the start of the race at the Erasmus square. The starting number should be worn clearly on the front of the contestant's clothing.

# Time registration

The contest features automatic time registration via the IPICO Sports system via chips attached to every contestant's shoes. The chips are handed out alongside the starting number and need to be turned in after finishing. The organization cannot guarantee all times are registered properly.

# Results

The organization will publish all results and rankings after the contest. You can object to the results at any time, but the organization does not have any obligation to change the results and/or rankings in any way.

# Liability

Participation in the Campusrun is completely at the contestant's own risk.
